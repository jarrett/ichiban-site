This folder is for scripts that generate pages.

If you want some auto-generated code *within a single page*, it's easy: Just use some <% %> tags.
But suppose you have an XML file describing every employee in your company, and you want an
*individual* page for each one. That's where this folder coms in. You need to create a script
that generates each page based on a template. See the documentation for more details.
