# Note on infinite .html appending loops: We have to take pains to ensure that if a certain file, say foo.html, exists,
# then a path like /foo/bar won't get .html appended an infinite number of times. This can happen because %{REQUEST_FILENAME}
# would match /foo/bar/ to foo.html. Our redirect to force trailing slashes then sends us through an infinite loop.
